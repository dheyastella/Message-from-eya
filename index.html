Why should I return to you if you don't need me? So, if I leave, it's okay, right? Ah, yes, it's true, nothing has changed. You'll surely find someone new, just like you did after we broke up that year. I haven't forgotten, I won't forget that disappointment.

You know? I still accepted you, even though that disappointment lingers to this day, because my feelings remain. Because I have no desire to forcefully erase you, I let my feelings and thoughts of you fade naturally.  And after that, I'm sure I can be happy and start over. And I will make sure I never return.

Why did you offer your love to a girl who enjoys freedom and throws away your trust in her? You shouldn't have done that.

But regardless of all that, I understand you. I know your hopes, I know you. But you don't know me, the things I like and dislike, the sadness I carry that I've never shared with anyone, not even you.  The truth is, we didn't have that kind of relationship, a relationship of mutual support, sharing problems, honesty, joy and sorrow, sweet arguments, playful jealousy, affection, and happiness. So, all this time, we never had a real relationship; it was just temporary comfort and a trap, wasn't it?

But now I've found a reason to escape that trap. If you don't actually need me and can manage your world alone (I'm proud of you), I only need to pray for you from afar until I forget about you and disappear.

My best wishes for you, and for myself as well.  Hopefully, next time, I won't choose the wrong person again, and I can be happy and free, even better than before.

I'm sorry, honey, we really need to lose contact.  Going no contact is the best path for us, so there won't be any more hopes that end in pain.  What I said ‚Äì that I don't want to see you again, don't want to know about you, and don't want you to know about my life, is true. And I don't want to be friends with you like before, I'm sorry.

But I'm grateful you were in my life, even if it was only for a short time.  Therefore, I'll always pray for you to be well, healthy, and to continue living a good life.

Go ahead and find someone new, just like you did after we broke up.  It's easy for you, right? To find someone to replace me? It's okay, because all this time you weren't really in this relationship; it was just me, all alone.  And I wasn't a good person for you, because I couldn't support you directly, like a normal relationship. I couldn't lessen your fatigue and overthinking that you always told me about.  One thing, Haikal, I just wanted to help and be useful to you, so I wouldn't feel useless, but now? I always don't understand you. What kind of love language would suit you from what I have? Haha, I'm confused. There are so many things about me that you don't know, and I really wanted to show you.  I can use all love languages, gifts and words to make someone comfortable. My presence makes people comfortable; that's why their hidden stories flow out naturally when I'm around them. I could be a good listener for you, but you never shared anything, even though I was waiting, but now it doesn't matter anymore, it's meaningless.

I always remember what you said two years ago, something like, "Find someone who loves you more than I love you." I don't know if you were serious or just joking, but that statement was a good wish for me, right? If so, thank you so much.

Maybe someday I'll accept someone who loves me more than I love myself, haha. A good wish for me, and for you too, Haikal. And maybe, another time, we'll have more time, honey.  Best wishes for you, and please pray for me too, because your prayers are very important and valuable to me.

Be happy, honey, always. I pray for you, and I'll always be the first to be happy and proud because you're still standing strong, healthy, continuing to live well, achieving everything you want, your dreams, and your happiness. Especially, I really admire how you make your mother happy and prioritize her; I'm very inspired by that.

now, it seems i'm ready to leave you.
even though it's that short, i'm so happy with you and i prayed for you.¬†

letting you go is the deepest form of my love, be happy strangerü§ç

tbh, i still miss you, but i won't bother you anymore
